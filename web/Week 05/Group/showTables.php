// This example connects to a database on the local server,
// if you are trying to connect to a database at heroku,
// you would want to change these lines to get the info
// from the heroku environment variable.
// It would be better to store these in a different file

	$db = new PDO("pgsql:host=$dbHost;port=$dbPort;dbname=$dbName", $dbUser, $dbPassword);
	// this line makes PDO give us an exception when there are problems, and can be very helpful in debugging!

<?php
// In this example, for simplicity, the query is executed
// right here and the data echoed out as we iterate the query.
// You could imagine that in a more involved application, we
// would likely query the database in a completely separate file / function
// and build a list of objects that held the components of each
// scripture. Then, here on the page, we could simply call that 
// function, and iterate through the list that was returned and
// print each component.
// First, prepare the statement
// Notice that we avoid using "SELECT *" here. This is considered
// good practice so we don't inadvertently bring back data we don't
// want, especially if the database changes later.
$statement = $db->prepare("SELECT book, chapter, verse, content FROM scriptures");
$statement->execute();
// Go through each result
while ($row = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC))
{
	// The variable "row" now holds the complete record for that
	// row, and we can access the different values based on their
	// name
	echo '<p>';
	echo '<strong>' . $row['book'] . ' ' . $row['chapter'] . ':';
	echo $row['verse'] . '</strong>' . ' - ' . $row['content'];
	echo '</p>';
